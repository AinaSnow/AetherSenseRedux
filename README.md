Turn your Warrior of Light into the Warrior of Butt with regex-powered realtime log parsing. Configure custom vibration patterns for game controllers, bluetooth-enabled sex toys, and more!

### Support

This project is a labor of love, and I don't earn any money for developing it. But if you've gotten something out of it and want to give back, please, buy me a coffee!
